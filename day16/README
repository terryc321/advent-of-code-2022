not interested in how get from "A" to "B"
may be several ways - sometime multiple ways of equal distance using different tunnels
only interested in valves that open that increase flow rate


focus on valves that if open , enable total pressure relieved to increase
ignore valves that have zero
sorted locations from highest flow to lowest flow

solve

all valves are closed
cost of 1 to open valve

want most water flowing for longest time

nobody will spend cost 1 to open valve with flow rate zero 0
the valves A F G I will never be opened as they flow no water

suppose had program P to compute cost of a
specific journey

could P be reverse engineered or symbolically
computed to discover optimum path to take ??
