given wind locations and directions

initially explorer at position (x=1,y=0)
explorer trying to get to (x=width,y=height+1)
playfield is width , height in size

we can compute next step

(define *input*
  '((120 25) (1 0) (120 25 >) (119 25 v) (118 25 v) (117 25 >) (116 25 ^) ....

from input 120 across by 25 down excluding walls and entry exit points

so according to this there is a wind facing right at the bottom right hand corner
of the playfield
