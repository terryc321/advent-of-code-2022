# scheme

possibly the nicest candidate

should be fairly clean

lacks two dimensional arrays which is crippling , most advent of code requires a grid
of some sort

painful to determine how to get 2d arrays working



# common lisp

failure to keep lexical scoping


# emacs text editor as a grid

poor interface

not sure if its doing correctly

various modes interacting , not sure what is active
