Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

Blueprint 2:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.

for blueprint 1 stated best can do is 9 geodes , but simulation shows should be 11 geodes

we have 11 geode
(next next buy-clay next next buy-clay next next buy-clay next next buy-clay next next next buy-obsidian next next next buy-obsidian next next next buy-geode next next buy-obsidian next next buy-geode next next buy-geode next next)


next     - advance state 
buy-clay - cost 2 ore
buy-obsidian - cost 3 ore and 14 clay
buy-geode
